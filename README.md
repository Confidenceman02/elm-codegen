# elm-prefabber



## Goals 
- [] - Auto-generate import statements by hoisting used values.  Be able to define aliases at the top level
- [] - Auto-hoist exposing declarations for top level decls
- [] - Auto format names so they're syntactically valid elm.
- [] - Parenthize function calls when necessary


There may also be some opportunity to build up signatures and expressions in paralell.  

Such as when defining a top level record.


Separately, it would be realllly cool if this library could generate a helper library for generating code for any package in the elm ecosystem.
